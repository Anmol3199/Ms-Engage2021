 ## Major Learnings
 
1) Agile Methodology: Through the 4 week span of the project, I undertook weekly sprints and made sure that small features get implemented in an efficient and time bound manner. Having a usable version of the product from the very beginning and seeing it evolve through the days and weeks was a joyful experience.

2) Perseverance and debugging skills: Having faced numerous bugs that seemed impossible to solve at first to actually overcoming them felt like victory. It improved my problem solving skills and faith in hardwork.

3) New Technologies: The project was a fun introduction to webRTC, sockets and databases for me and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the new technologies. With the help of my friends and mentors as well as self study I was able to grow my knowledge.

4) Growth mindset: The sessions as well as the project taught me that our skills can be improved and having a growth mindset helps one and their organization in the long run.
